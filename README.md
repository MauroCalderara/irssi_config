# irssi_config

My configuration for the irssi IRC client. 

Installation
---

To install clone recursively (git clone --recursively) into .irssi, assuming you don't have your own configuration there. I use git filters to remove my personal data from the configuration, so you'll need to update the 'config' file with your settings. If you want them to be applied automatically upon checkout, see '.git-filters/[clean|smudge]-passwords'.
